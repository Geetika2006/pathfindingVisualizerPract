# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive Pathfinding Visualizer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to demonstrate how different graph traversal and shortest-path algorithms work on a grid.

This project visually compares algorithms based on:
- nodes visited
- shortest path length
- execution time

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Set **Start** and **Target** nodes
- 🧱 Draw and erase **walls**
- 🧹 Clear path / walls / entire board
- ⚡ Control **animation speed**
- 🧠 Visual comparison of algorithms
- 📊 Performance metrics displayed:
  - Time taken (ms)
  - Visited cells
  - Path length

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **DFS (Depth First Search)**
- **BFS (Breadth First Search)**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- **A\* Search Algorithm**
- **Greedy Best First Search**

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Each algorithm execution displays:
- **Time Taken** – computation time using `performance.now()`
- **Visited Cells** – number of nodes explored
- **Path Length** – length of the final path (if found)

> ⚠️ Note: Time measured is algorithm execution time, not animation time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
- Priority Queue for weighted algorithms
