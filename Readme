# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive **Pathfinding Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to understand how different pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms work on a grid.

This project helped me learn how algorithms behave visually rather than just memorizing theory.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive grid with start and end nodes
- Create walls/obstacles by clicking on the grid
- Visualize different pathfinding algorithms step-by-step
- Clear grid and reset anytime
- Simple and clean UI for easy understanding

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**  
  Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

- **Depth First Search (DFS)**  
  Explores deeply first and does not always guarantee the shortest path.

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**  
  Guarantees the shortest path using distance calculation.

- **A\* Algorithm**  
  Optimized version of Dijkstra using heuristics for faster performance.
